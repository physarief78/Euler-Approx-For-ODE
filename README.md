In this repository, i uploaded my assignment on Computational Physics subject. It's about an exercise to execute the Euler approximation method on physics problems, especially solving for ODE.
I will uploaded my jupyter notebook about how i solved the problem and i will uploaded my PDF analysis about the problem that i solved. I hope this help and y'all can enjoy...
If there are some problem let's discuss it together!
